## Introduction

Unfortunately with all software development, security vulnerabilities are a
fact of life that need to be addressed. It is important that when security
vulnerabilities are found that researchers have an easy channel to the
projects in question allowing them to disclose the issue to a controlled
group of people. Furthermore the process how a reported issues is then
solved and the solution and information provided to the general public must
be clear to all parties involved: the researcher, the project leads and
the user base. Especially today where PHP developers are sharing code across
projects more than ever, it also adds another dimension: how to deal with
upstream projects to ensure they have sufficient time to prepare themselves.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][].

[RFC 2119]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119

## Goal

The goal of this PSR is to give researchers, project leads, upstream project
leads and end user a defined and structured process for disclosing security
vulnerabilities.
